                <p>Hi, my name is Genc and this site is really for my own use but decided to make things available to anyone that might find it useful. This is where I keep track of links, articles, books, try out code, or just play around with and test stuff. Named it externality because I think it's an important concept to take into account when doing anything.</p>
                <p>The site is simple, no moving parts. Code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/genckastrati/externality">respository</a>. You also have a bunch of links to some projects, Twitter/LinkedIn/GitHub, and the <a href="https://read.externality.ch">WP instance</a> used as a library. Feel free to send me an email.</p>
                <p>For those curious about the definition of externality, here it is:</p>
                <blockquote>externality: a consequence of an industrial or commercial activity which affects other parties without this being reflected in market prices, such as the pollination of surrounding crops by bees kept for honey</blockquote>
                <p>If you haven't done so yet, please read this beautiful passage written by Sagan to accompany a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot">photo  of Earth</a> taken by Voyager 1 on 14 February 1990 from 6.4 billion kilometers away:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br/><br/>
                    The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.<br/><br/>
                    Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.<br/><br/>
                    The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.<br/><br/>
                    It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.<br/><br/>
                    — Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994
